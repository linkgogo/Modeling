#Description : 
This program is used for building Ocean model's  essential program skill. It including 2D filter, numerical approach, interpolating skill, and other algorithms.
This program is mostly written in Fortran 90. The netCDF API library is also necessary for Fortran compiler. Make sure your install diretory. 
I also put some model test-case for running the models. If the test run needs the MPI program, make sure the mpirun is work in your computer.
